Historicizing Visual Culture
Final Project
HIST 404, "Photography and US Politics," Fall 2017


At its best, the study of cultural history gives us broader contexts to understand the world beyond our own lived experience.  This course seeks to understand one crucial element of that world – the realm of visual culture.  In keeping with this vision, the goal of the final project is for you to think about the relation between past and present: it asks that you analyze a “visual moment” in the present (or recent past) by thinking about its connections to the visual history that we have explored over the course of the semester.  
	
Your task is to identify a “visual moment” and argue for its significance.  A “visual moment” might include imagery of a recent protest, a crucial photojournalistic event, the use of images as legal evidence, discussions of the potential use of images (such as body cameras for police), or a noteworthy documentary film.
	
Your analysis should draw upon the conceptual tools we have explored over the course of the semester.  Think of the theorists we have read, such as Sontag, Burke, and Nichols.  Take into account the questions we have asked about production, reception, words and images, iconography, and authenticity.  No matter what you end up studying, your project must consider the visual moment in relation to the longer history of visual culture.  How does it extend the history of images, visual practices, and debates we have discussed?  Would you place it in certain trajectories and traditions that emerge in the nineteenth and twentieth century?  Likewise, how does it depart from this history?
